Hello and welcome to our (attempt at a) file system.

Here is a brief overview of what we designed, and what it supports:
- a 1MB block. It contains offest values at the front,
  two bitmaps follow representing availability of inodes and data
  blocks, and then a series of inodes and data blocks
- directory system that to support a network of directories
  and files


So this is what is working:
- You can mount. (but not remount)
- You can create files with different names
- You can list files in the root directory.
- You can read and write to files.
- those files you wrote to, you can read the contents.
- soft links
- metadata

Most of the functionality was implemented, but it's not working correctly.
This is not working:
- you can't delete files.
- you can't create nested directories and delete them.
etc.


No additional functionality not asked for the assignment was implemented.
The assignment's tasks were more than enough for us to handle :/
